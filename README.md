Drone Dashboard - Real-Time Monitoring
This project is a real-time drone telemetry dashboard built using Streamlit and Plotly. The dashboard allows you to monitor essential drone telemetry data such as battery voltage, IMU data, GPS position, and connection health through an interactive and visually appealing web interface.

Features
Real-Time Data Simulation: Telemetry data like battery voltage, IMU (roll, pitch, yaw), temperature, altitude, GPS position, and connection health are simulated and updated every 2 seconds to reflect real-time changes.

Interactive Gauge & Graph Visualizations: All telemetry data is visualized using interactive Plotly graphs and gauges for an intuitive and easy-to-read interface.

Page Navigation: The app includes a bottom navigation bar that allows users to seamlessly switch between the Home, Telemetry, Location, and About pages.

Custom Animations: The navigation icons are animated to enhance the user experience, adding a more polished feel to the interface.

Print-Friendly Layout: The content is optimized for printing, ensuring it is well-structured and fits neatly when printed out line-by-line.

Pages
Home: The welcome screen provides an introduction to the drone dashboard and its capabilities.

Telemetry: This page displays real-time telemetry data, including battery voltage, IMU data (roll, pitch, yaw), temperature, and signal strength.

Location: Displays the drone's GPS data — latitude, longitude, and altitude — in an interactive map.

About: A description of the project, its objectives, and the technology behind the dashboard.

Requirements
To run the project locally, you need the following dependencies:

Python 3.x

Streamlit: For creating the web app.

Plotly: For interactive visualizations.

Pandas: For handling data.

Numpy: For generating and manipulating data.
